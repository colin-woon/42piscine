Note:  
- Underscores ( _ ) shows how many retries made on the project, you should refer to the highest number for the correct code  
(eg: c02_2, retried 2 times)  
- There are also some attempts made on extra exercises but were marked wrong by the Moulinette grading system, hence the score stops there.  
(eg: c03_2, ex04 - KO, but ex05 - OK) & (eg: c07, ex04 - KO, but ex05 - OK) 
- For C04, there is an extra attempt at local4 for ex04 and ex05, these were not submitted to be graded by Moulinette but the code works as intended.

It was a great experience to learn from different peers. Do utilize these resources to help you get through your piscine.  
- Ctutor (to visualize C code, helpful up until C07)  
- ChatGPT (understand concepts faster, and can be used to check minor errors in your code)

(DO NOT COPY THE CODES, THEY ARE TO BE USED FOR REFERENCE ONLY, GOOD LUCK!)
