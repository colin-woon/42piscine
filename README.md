It was a great experience to learn from different peers. Do utilize these resources to help you get through your piscine.  
- Ctutor (to visualize C code, helpful up until C07)  
- ChatGPT (understand concepts faster, and can be used to check minor errors in your code)

(DO NOT COPY THE CODES, THEY ARE TO BE USED FOR REFERENCE ONLY, GOOD LUCK!)
